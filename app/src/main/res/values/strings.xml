I once served as captain of Taiwan University badminton team, and led the team to get the year\'\'s college cup runner-up. It was the school team\'\'s best ever.\nSecond, I am very results-oriented. No matter which field, I can always conquer difficulties in the shortest possible time, create performance and achieve goals. When I was a project manager at Nestlé, I was able to meet performance targets for 24 consecutive months.\nFinally, I have the entrepreneurial spirit. I am often given the task of new business. Last season, I introduced the "coffee education and training activities" in Nestlé, it was very successful and all the classes were fully registered until end of the year.\nBased on the above characteristics, I believe I can make a great contribution to the company. Thank you."</string>
