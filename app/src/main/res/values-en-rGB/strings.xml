    <string name="editor_example_three_title">"Self-intro (1 minute)"</string>
    <string name="editor_example_three_content">"Hello, I am (name). I believe I have three strong points:\nFirst, I am a team player. I am good at boosting morale and I can lead the team to achieve their goals. I once served as captain of the badminton team in university, and our team was the runner-up of the college cup. It was the school team's best result ever.\nSecond, I am very results-oriented. No matter the field, I can always overcome difficulties in the shortest possible time and achieve goals with a top-notch performance. When I was a project manager at my former company, I was able to meet performance targets for 24 consecutive months.\nFinally, I have an entrepreneurial spirit. I am often given the task of handling new businesses. Last season, I introduced \"coffee education and training activities\" in my former company. It was very successful, and all classes were fully booked until the end of the year.\nBased on these characteristics, I believe I can make a great contribution to the company. Thank you."</string>
